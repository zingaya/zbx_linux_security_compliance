1.1
Changes:
- Added new params to lock/hold and unlock/unhold packages.
  - Yum already filters those that are locked, but changed the apt when listing updates to remove those holded.
  - The list of apt packages are without the repository (ex: "packagename/repository 1.1.1 amd64").
  - Removed the javascript function in the zabbix preprocessor to remove the repository, and added to diplay the error when trying to list updates into the 'updates.pending.list' item.
- Improved errors handling Ansible/Python.
- Added an option to escalate privileges using Ansible (become).
- Case insensitive for param --sshcheck (True/true - False/false)

Notes: 
- When locking/unlocking a package fails, it would not proceed to update/upgrade. As a failsafe in case you do not want to upgrade a package.
- For Ansible yum-versionlock module, now requires to install the collection. Added it into README.
